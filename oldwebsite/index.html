            <h2 id="blogPostTitle">Blog Post #1 | Intro</h2>
            <p id="blogText">Hey, my name's Jahvon! I'm 14 (15 in 3 months!) and creating this website for a school project, but I plan to use it for other things such as the multiple games/utilities I made. Talking about making things, I have a <u><b>lot</b></u> of hobbies and I love every single one. My favourite though, is coding (as you can see). I've been coding for over <u><b>6 years</b></u> in multiple [programming] languages. I'm fluent in Python, Java, C++, JS, HTML/CSS and many more. I'm okay at/learning C, Rust & Go. Some other things I love to do include building/creating things, Cubing & Parkour in general!</p>

            <h2 id="blogPostTitle2">Blog Post #2 | My Passion</h2>
            <p id="blogText2">If you know me in real life, you probably know that I <u><b>love</b></u> languages. I love everything about them and even just having the ability to speak some words means a lot to me. I've been learning for exactly two years in a row as of today (05/01/24) languages on Duolingo. I now know German & French very well while now I'm learning russian. I think this would be a great opportunity for me to try a <u><b>new</b></u> type of language. For me, I've always wanted to try learning ASL (or sign-language). I've started a few times before but never got to a point where I knew it well, I couldn't even introduce myself. For this challenge, I want to learn ASL and be on the level of introducing myself including talking about my name (even just in an initial), where I'm from, and things I like to do. In my opinion, even being able to speak at this level is still a valuable skill. This also opens up other opportunities for me in the future. Say I really like ASL, then I'll already understand some basics and it'll be easy for me to continue!</p>
