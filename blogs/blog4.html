        <p id="text">Well, it’s finally become time to talk about my final outcome or my “product”. This assignment has been made up of a lot of different parts and skills, especially focusing on my memorization and perfection with creating the signs. I know for sure that I was successful with creating my product knowing that I can do every sign with most of them much quicker than my first times. I can remember them all well and even change up the sentences a little. I made sure to work through the signs on many different occasions, like at home where I would show my family members what I learned. I also found that doing the signs all at once rather than how some people just do one thing at a time until it’s perfect, really helps. It just makes it easier for me if you put all of it together. To be fully honest, this was pretty straightforward. I didn’t find any big challenges with my learning from this due to the memorising being pretty simple along with creating the signs. They were all pretty easy and things I had done before (I’ve made some signs before but never remembered anything. I’m not sure if I’m truly committed to learning ASL. It was fun for a little bit but I don’t really seem to enjoy it as much as I enjoy <b><u>speaking</u></b> other languages. I think I’m going to stop but maybe I’ll continue one day in the future, especially if it becomes useful (like speaking to a deaf friend/family member.) This project has of course opened up some opportunities for me and helped me understand some parts of the language but all in all, I don’t think that it really changed my life significantly.
