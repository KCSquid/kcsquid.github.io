        <h1 id="title">Blog Post #4 Interview</h1>
        <p id="text">So recently, I conducted an interview with Brooke who is an expert with ASL. My first question with her was how I would be able to easily see and remember the signs I saw people do. Her answer was pretty straightforward stating that “It takes a lot of practice, a lot of repetition and watching carefully.” I think this is true to almost everything you learn and is a generally good rule of thumb. My second question was similar but slightly different. I asked how I could easily <b>differentiate</b> between signs. It might be eventually easy to watch and remember but some signs could be confusing and cause difficulty with understanding in a timely manner. She told me that I can “make connections to certain signs that look like certain words”, which should make it easier because “it can help you to remember what those words are.”, at a much faster pace. Finally, I asked her if it was okay to finger sign words I don’t know. She told me that it’s “okay at first”, but I should practise those words and remember them for the future so it doesn’t constantly happen. I think this interview was pretty helpful and should probably allow me to learn a little better if I’m in a situation where I am talking to or watching a deaf person.
