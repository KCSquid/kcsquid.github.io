        <p id="text">So recently, I’ve been working on memorising my ASL. I actually thought at the start of this activity that remembering hand signs would be really hard and that verbal languages would be much easier. Now, I might feel different. After beginning with my name and the spelling<sup><a href="https://www.lingvano.com/asl/blog/sign-language-alphabet/">[1]</a></sup>, I tried to practice it over and over until I felt I could do it well and most importantly, <b><u>quickly</b></u>. The key part would be doing this fast because I find it <b><u>really</b></u> helps with memorisation. After being able to do my name well, I went on to things like age<sup><a href="https://www.handspeak.com/learn/134/">[2]</a></sup> which were pretty easy due to the fact that it was only one extra sign. Spelling where I live<sup><a href="https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/l/live.htm">[3]</a></sup> was simple due to me already knowing the alphabet pretty well which really speeded up my learning. Finally, I learned how to do things I like<sup><a href="https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/l/like.htm">[4]</a></sup> such as coding<sup><a href="https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/p/program.htm">[5]</a></sup> or going outside<sup><a href="https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/o/outside.htm">[6]</a></sup> which was a little difficult but it turned out okay in the end. After all this learning, I’m convinced that I could introduce myself well and talk a little bit to someone deaf due to some similarity of signs to actions.
