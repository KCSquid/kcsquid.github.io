        <p id="text">If you know me in real life, you probably know that I <u><b>love</b></u> languages. I love everything about them and even just having the ability to speak some words means a lot to me. I've been learning for exactly two years in a row as of today (05/01/24), new languages on Duolingo. I now know German &amp; French very well while now I'm learning Russian. I think this would be a great opportunity for me to try a <u><b>new</b></u> type of language. For me, I've always wanted to try learning ASL (or sign-language). I've started a few times before but never got to a point where I knew it well, I couldn't even introduce myself. For this challenge, I want to learn ASL and be on the level of introducing myself including talking about my name (even just in an initial), where I'm from, and things I like to do. In my opinion, even being able to speak at this level is still a valuable skill. This also opens up other opportunities for me in the future. Say I really like ASL, then I'll already understand some basics and it'll be easy for me to continue! The easiest part of this project will be that I‚Äôve already learned some languages. It‚Äôs actually a fact that the more languages you know, the easier it will be for your brain to learn new ones! I think the hardest part of this challenge on the other hand will be remembering the hand signs. I can remember words easily but physically doing something might not be nearly as easy. All I‚Äôm going to need to start is the internet and a device and from there it will be easy. I‚Äôll probably download an app and use some popular ASL websites. I‚Äôm very excited to start this task and truly believe it will be fun. üòÅ
